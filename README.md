# Final Sprint - Group 2 - Robot Obstacle Course

Steps to Complete the Project:

1. Understand the Course Layout:
    	•	Study the diagram of the hallway and the positions (A-H).
   
    	•	Note the tasks associated with each position:
   
    	•	A: Start and end point.
   
    	•	B: Move along the top horizontal line.
   
    	•	C, E, G: Check for markers (F, D, P).
   
    	•	D: Dangerous, skip.
   
    	•	F: Perform different tasks based on the marker (1, 2, 3).
   
    	•	H: Turnaround point.
     
3. Programming Tasks:
    	•	Set up the robot’s movement and marker detection in Python.
   
    	•	Implement functions to handle different markers and their associated actions.
